This project has a CNN model to predict classes of fashion items from MNIST dataset.

Simply upload the model.ipynb Jupyter notebook into Colab along with the Fashion MNIST dataset and run the code to train the model and obtain predictions.

For the improved model that was not included on the Kaggle leaderboard, simply copy the lines of code in the model2.py file and paste it into the main code, relpacing the current model.
